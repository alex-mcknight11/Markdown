# My Day

**On an average day**, I wake up, take a shower, brush my teeth, and do what I need to get ready for class at _Epicodus_, the coding school I've been going to!

At Epicodus, I can learn how to
* Code
* Work in pair programming environments
* Further my career

**After class**, I walk the dog I'm watching, _Beau_! Beau is a [Mini Aussie Doodle](https://www.hepper.com/miniature-aussiedoodle/) and is very friendly! Sometimes he'll get scared by bigger dogs though. Typically our walks go like this.
